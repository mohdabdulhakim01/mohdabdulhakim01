# ðŸ˜¹ Welcome to My Profile

Hello, My name is Mohammad Abdul Hakim. I'm freelance developer but mostly doing PHP project since that's all i'm good thoo. I love playing mobile game and doing some new weird project.

My coding skill is pretty average and my method is pretty much dirt cheap as long as it working. If I have time to rewritten my old code, I can do it (*Nah*)

Nothing to see here except all of this are just my side hobby project from my early programming journey till now. Some project indeed being use by myself and some is easily forgotten. My coding is nothing impressive to be honest but the idea itself is what drive me to create many weird project here.
