# ðŸ˜¹ Welcome to My Profile

Hello, My name is Mohammad Abdul Hakim. I'm freelance developer but mostly doing PHP project since that's all i'm good thoo. I love playing mobile game and doing some new weird project.

My coding skill is pretty average and my method is pretty much dirt cheap as long as it working. If I have time to rewritten my old code, I would like to (*Nah*)

Nothing to see here except all of this are just my side hobby project from my early programming journey till now. Some project indeed being use by myself and some is easily forgotten. My coding is nothing impressive to be honest but the idea itself is what drive me to create many weird project here. I'm not an expert for either backend or frontend, but if you need cheap,jack of all trade kind of person for your small project, you found the right person.
